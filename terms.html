			<div class="whitetext"> 
			<p><strong>Last updated: September 21, 2020</strong></p>
			<p>Please read these Terms of Use (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;, &ldquo;Terms of Use&rdquo;) carefully before using <a href="https://astrotools.io">https://astrotools.io</a> and <a href="https://astro.exchange">https://astro.exchange</a> (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) operated by AstroTools Corp (&ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;).</p>
			<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
			<p>By accessing or using the Service, irrespective of free trial or paid access, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
			<p>The AstroTools network (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) is comprised of various web pages, including AstroTools.io, Astro.Exchange, and AstroTools.ETH, operated by AstroTools Corp (&ldquo;AstroTools&rdquo;). AstroTools is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein (the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;). Your use of the Site constitutes your agreement to all such Terms. Please read these terms carefully, and keep a copy of them for your reference.</p>
			<p><strong>RISKS</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Cryptocurrency trading can be extremely risky.</strong> Customers should be prepared to lose all of the funds that they have in their account for cryptocurrency trading and more. They should not fund their cryptocurrency trading activities with retirement savings, student loans, second mortgages, emergency funds, funds set aside for purposes such as education or home ownership, or funds required for current income.</p>
			<p><strong>Customers must be cautious of claims of large profits from cryptocurrency trading.</strong> Customers need to be wary of advertisements or other statements that emphasize the potential for large profits in cryptocurrency trading. Cryptocurrency trading can also lead to large and immediate financial losses. Cryptocurrency trading requires knowledge of financial markets.</p>
			<p><strong>Cryptocurrency trading requires in-depth knowledge of the securities and tradeable utilities markets as well as trading techniques and strategies.</strong> In attempting to profit through cryptocurrency trading, an investor must compete with professional, licensed traders employed by firms often with large funds. An investor should have appropriate experience before engaging in cryptocurrency trading.</p>
			<p><strong>Cryptocurrency trading requires knowledge of a firm&rsquo;s operations.</strong> An investor should be familiar with a firm&rsquo;s business practices, including the operation of the firm&rsquo;s order execution systems, procedures, and should confirm that a firm has adequate systems capacity to permit customers to engage in cryptocurrency trading activities.</p>
			<p><strong>Cryptocurrency trading may result in large commissions.</strong> Cryptocurrency trading may require an investor to trade his or her account aggressively, and pay commissions on each trade. The total daily commissions that they pay on trades may add to losses or significantly reduce earnings.</p>
			<p><strong>Cryptocurrency trading on margin or short selling may result in losses beyond the initial investment.</strong> When customers trade with funds borrowed from a firm or someone else, they can lose more than the funds originally placed at risk. A decline in the value of the securities that are purchased may require additional funds be paid to the firm to avoid the forced sale of those securities or other securities in an investors account. Short selling as part of a cryptocurrency trading strategy also may lead to extraordinary losses, because asset may have to be purchased at a very high price in order to cover a short position.</p>
